    <H1>WEB AND APP</H1>
    <p>Web application development is the creation of application programs that reside on remote servers and are
        delivered to the user's device over the Internet. A web application (web app) does not need to be downloaded and
        is instead accessed through a network.</p>
    <H1>What is Web Development?</H1>
    <P>Web development is the continuous loop of designing, developing, and maintaining websites through consistent
        development and deployment! Web design, content management, web programming, as well as database management are
        all included. The process is all about the development of an internet-based application, such as a website.

        Further, web development can be classified into frontend development and backend development! The development
        process of the front face of a website with which the user directly interacts is referred to as the front end.
        It is also known as the application’s “client side.” Whereas, the server side of a webpage is referred to as the
        backend. It is that section of the concerned website that users wouldn’t see and interact with. It is that part
        of the software that has no direct contact with users. Instead, it is used to organize and store data.</P>
