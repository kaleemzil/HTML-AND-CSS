    <H1>CYBER SECURITY</H1>
    <p>Cyber Security is a professional field that covers the fundamental concepts underlying the construction of secure
        systems that includes Information, Hardware and Software and Networks.

        Upon completion of this specialisation, students should be able to defend and/or secure computer-based systems
        from vulnerabilities and malicious attacks. This would help students to expand their job prospects as a Security
        Auditor, Security Manager, Security Solutions Specialist, Security Consultant, Security Architect, Information
        Security Officer, Incident Responder, Security Administrator, Penetration Tester, Vulnerability Assessor and
        more.</p>
    <h1>Computer and Network Security</h1>
    <p>This module focuses on security, trust, policy including security life cycle; layering & distribution of security
        mechanisms. Students will investigate threats to networks, protection mechanisms focusing on encryption,
        authentication protocols, digital signatures for message integrity, secure Internet Protocols, security and
        mobility issues and security application programming interfaces.</p>
    <h1>Computer Intrusion Detection</h1>
    <p>This module looks into computer intrusion detection areas such as: identifying and exposing security weaknesses
        in an organisation and selecting the proper countermeasures, understand how hacking tools can be used to test
        and improve security, protect against and prevent intrusions.</p>
    <h1>Secured Software Systems</h1>
    <p>This module will provide students with the knowledge and experience needed to develop secure software. Students
        should be able to audit source codes for security vulnerabilities, identify vulnerabilities in open and closed
        source third-party applications and develop proof-of-concept exploits. This module will also cover theoretical
        and fundamental principles of cryptography and general system security.</p>
    <h1>Software Developer</h1>
    <p>Software developers create software programs that allow users to perform specific tasks on various devices, such
        as computers or mobile devices. Software developers must have the technical creativity required to solve
        problems uniquely. They need to be fluent in computer languages that are used to write the code for programs.
